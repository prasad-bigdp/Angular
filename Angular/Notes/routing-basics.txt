Routing in Angular refers to the mechanism that allows you to navigate between different components and views based on the URL. Angular's built-in router provides a powerful and flexible way to implement navigation in your application. Here's an overview of how routing works in Angular:

Key Concepts:
Router Module (RouterModule):

Angular's routing functionality is provided by the RouterModule. You need to import this module in your Angular application to enable routing.

// app.module.ts
import { RouterModule } from '@angular/router';

@NgModule({
  imports: [RouterModule.forRoot(routes)],
  exports: [RouterModule],
})
Routes:

Routes are an array of route definitions that map URLs to Angular components. Each route is an object that defines a path and the component to be displayed when the path is navigated to.

const routes: Routes = [
  { path: '', component: HomeComponent },
  { path: 'about', component: AboutComponent },
  { path: 'contact', component: ContactComponent },
];
Router Outlet:

The <router-outlet></router-outlet> directive is used as a placeholder in the template where the routed component will be displayed.

<!-- app.component.html -->
<router-outlet></router-outlet>
RouterLink:

The routerLink directive is used for creating navigation links in your templates. It generates the appropriate navigation URLs based on the route configuration.

<!-- app.component.html -->
<a routerLink="/">Home</a>
<a routerLink="/about">About</a>
<a routerLink="/contact">Contact</a>
Basic Usage:
Setting Up Routes:

Define your routes in the Routes array.
Configuring RouterModule:

Import RouterModule in your main AppModule and configure it with the defined routes using RouterModule.forRoot(routes).
Router Outlet:

Place <router-outlet></router-outlet> in your main template. This is where the routed components will be rendered.
RouterLink:

Use the routerLink directive in your templates to create navigation links.
Route Parameters:
You can include route parameters to make your routes dynamic. For example:

const routes: Routes = [
  { path: 'product/:id', component: ProductDetailComponent },
];
Access the parameter in the component:

// product-detail.component.ts
import { ActivatedRoute } from '@angular/router';

// ...

constructor(private route: ActivatedRoute) {
  this.route.params.subscribe(params => {
    console.log(params.id); // Access the 'id' parameter
  });
}
Nested Routes:
You can create nested routes by defining child routes within a route configuration.
const routes: Routes = [
  {
    path: 'admin',
    component: AdminComponent,
    children: [
      { path: 'dashboard', component: DashboardComponent },
      { path: 'settings', component: SettingsComponent },
    ]
  },
];
Route Guards:
Route guards allow you to run code before a route is activated. Common guards include CanActivate, CanDeactivate, CanLoad, and Resolve.

Lazy Loading:
Lazy loading enables you to load modules and their associated components only when they are needed, reducing the initial bundle size.
const routes: Routes = [
  { path: 'admin', loadChildren: () => import('./admin/admin.module').then(m => m.AdminModule) },
];
This is a high-level overview of Angular routing. It provides a flexible and powerful mechanism for navigation and structuring your Angular applications.
